scripts for productivity through automation

This script automatically moved read emails into what they're labelled as - moves them to the approprate label archive. You'll need to set up the filters to assign the labels yourseklf, but once emails are tagged with labels and have been read, they'll automatically be moved to their appropriate folders upon being read. I have the script on my email refreshing once every minute.
